# convert Mi Band5 to Mi Band6 watchface (python)

This is a Python function that takes in a JSON object, data, and two integer values, x_increment and y_increment. The function recursively increments the values of the keys x, y, TopLeftX, TopRightX, BottomLeftX, BottomRightX, TopLeftY, TopRightY, BottomLeftY, BottomRightY by x_increment and y_increment respectively. The function also ignores the key Shape and loads the JSON object from a file named black_neon_eco.json. The modified JSON object is then written back to the same file.
